<h3>Abstract</h3>
Electricity consumption forecasting plays a critical role in ensuring the efficient production and distribution of energy, minimizing issues such as power outages and load shedding. This study focuses on forecasting household electricity consumption using time series analysis to evaluate and compare the performance of various models. The models were divided into two categories: statistical models, including ARIMA, SARIMAX, and Linear Regression, and neural network models, such as RNN, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM, with additional comparisons to XGBoost and Random Forest. Metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and MAPE were used to evaluate prediction accuracy, though their limitations for small datasets were noted. To address this, aggregated metrics, including Mean Monthly Absolute Difference and Mean Monthly Absolute Difference Percentage, were introduced. The findings revealed that neural network models, particularly LSTM, outperformed others in predicting electricity consumption with a low error percentage. The study highlights the need for improved evaluation metrics tailored to smaller datasets and emphasizes the potential for advanced models to achieve greater forecasting accuracy. Future work will focus on exploring better metrics and incorporating a wider range of models.<br>
